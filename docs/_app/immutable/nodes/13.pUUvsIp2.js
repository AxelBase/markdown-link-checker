The Markdown Link Checker’s interactive results table includes powerful filtering, sorting, and search capabilities that help you focus on critical issues instantly.</p> <p class="svelte-ioqtrr">These controls sit above the table and update views in real time without re-running validation.</p> <h2 class="svelte-ioqtrr">Status Filtering</h2> <p class="svelte-ioqtrr">Dropdown menus let you show only specific categories: Valid, Broken, Redirected, Skipped, or Ignored. Select Broken to isolate problems immediately, or combine multiple selections for custom views.</p> <p class="svelte-ioqtrr">Clear filters with a single click when you want the full overview again.</p> <h2 class="svelte-ioqtrr">Column Sorting</h2> <p class="svelte-ioqtrr">Click any column header—Text, URL, Line, Status—to sort ascending or descending. Toggle between orders with repeated clicks.</p> <p class="svelte-ioqtrr">Sorting by Line number groups issues sequentially through your document, ideal for systematic fixes. URL sorting clusters links by domain, revealing patterns like widespread breakage on one host.</p> <h2 class="svelte-ioqtrr">Full-Text Search</h2> <p class="svelte-ioqtrr">The search bar matches across link text and URLs simultaneously. Type a domain name to see all references to that host, or enter visible text to locate specific references.</p> <p class="svelte-ioqtrr">Searches are case-insensitive and partial matches work throughout the string.</p> <h2 class="svelte-ioqtrr">Combining Features</h2> <p class="svelte-ioqtrr">Stack controls for precision: filter to Broken, sort by Line, then search for a particular domain to tackle highest-priority issues first.</p> <p class="svelte-ioqtrr">Or filter Redirected and sort by URL to batch-update links pointing to old locations.</p> <h2 class="svelte-ioqtrr">Workflow Examples</h2> <p class="svelte-ioqtrr">During pre-publish reviews, filter Broken and sort by Line to fix issues in reading order. When auditing external dependencies, search for specific domains across all statuses.</p> <p class="svelte-ioqtrr">Team leads filter Ignored to verify pattern coverage, while writers search for their section headings in anchor links.</p> <h2 class="svelte-ioqtrr">Performance Notes</h2> <p class="svelte-ioqtrr">All operations happen instantly in the browser, even with hundreds of entries. No data leaves your device during interaction.</p> <p class="svelte-ioqtrr">These tools turn raw results into an efficient triage system tailored to your immediate needs.</p> <p class="svelte-ioqtrr">Mastering the table controls dramatically reduces time spent reviewing and resolving link issues.</p> <p class="svelte-ioqtrr">From overwhelming lists to targeted action items—the difference is in the details.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-ioqtrr">Find and fix problems faster with smart table interaction.</p></article></div>');function F(d){var e=q();b(u=>{var s=k();g.title="Filtering, Sorting, and Searching Results | Markdown Link Checker Blog";var m=v(f(s),6);t(4),i(()=>l(m,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post9`)),a(u,s)});var r=o(e),h=o(r);t(4),n(r),t(2),n(e),i(()=>l(h,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),a(d,e)}export{F as component,T as universal};
