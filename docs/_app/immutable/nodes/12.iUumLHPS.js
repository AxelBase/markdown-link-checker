The Markdown Link Checker provides three straightforward export methods that preserve all details from your session without requiring accounts or external services.</p> <p class="svelte-5ha4w6">Export buttons appear prominently in the results section once validation completes, ready for immediate use.</p> <h2 class="svelte-5ha4w6">Plain Text Export</h2> <p class="svelte-5ha4w6">The TXT format produces a clean, human-readable report perfect for quick reviews or attaching to emails. It organizes results by status category with clear headings, then lists each link with text, URL, line number, and status code.</p> <p class="svelte-5ha4w6">Summary statistics appear at the top—total links, valid count, broken count—followed by grouped details. This format works seamlessly in any text editor or ticketing system.</p> <h2 class="svelte-5ha4w6">JSON Export</h2> <p class="svelte-5ha4w6">For programmatic use or integration, choose JSON export. The structured output includes an array of link objects with all properties: text, url, resolvedUrl, line, status, statusCode, and category.</p> <p class="svelte-5ha4w6">Developers can parse this data for custom dashboards, automated issue creation, or trend analysis across multiple validation runs. The JSON remains compact yet complete.</p> <h2 class="svelte-5ha4w6">Clipboard Copy</h2> <p class="svelte-5ha4w6">The fastest option copies the entire text report directly to your clipboard with one click. Paste instantly into chat messages, pull request comments, or documentation notes without saving files first.</p> <p class="svelte-5ha4w6">This method mirrors the TXT format for consistency while eliminating download steps during collaborative reviews.</p> <h2 class="svelte-5ha4w6">Practical Applications</h2> <p class="svelte-5ha4w6">Technical leads export JSON reports to track link health over time in repositories. Writers copy results to clipboard for immediate feedback in team channels. Compliance teams save TXT files as audit trails attached to release documentation.</p> <p class="svelte-5ha4w6">Open-source maintainers include exported reports in issues when requesting documentation fixes from contributors.</p> <h2 class="svelte-5ha4w6">File Naming and Safety</h2> <p class="svelte-5ha4w6">Downloads use descriptive names incorporating timestamp and input file name when available. All exports happen client-side—no data transmission occurs beyond your initial link checks.</p> <h2 class="svelte-5ha4w6">Choosing the Right Format</h2> <p class="svelte-5ha4w6">Use TXT for readability and sharing with non-technical stakeholders. Select JSON when automating workflows or analyzing data. Reach for clipboard copy during fast-paced discussions.</p> <p class="svelte-5ha4w6">Multiple formats ensure the right tool for every context, turning validation results into actionable assets across your team.</p> <p class="svelte-5ha4w6">Export features close the loop from discovery to resolution with minimal friction.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-5ha4w6">Share your validation insights effortlessly with flexible exports.</p></article></div>');function N(h){var e=x();g(u=>{var s=b();v.title="Exporting Reports: TXT, JSON, and Clipboard Options | Markdown Link Checker Blog";var m=f(w(s),6);t(4),o(()=>n(m,"content",`${p??""}/blog/posts/post8`)),r(u,s)});var a=i(e),d=i(a);t(4),l(a),t(2),l(e),o(()=>n(d,"href",`${p??""}/blog`)),r(h,e)}export{N as component,J as universal};
