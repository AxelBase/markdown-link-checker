The <a class="hover:underline">Markdown Link Checker</a> was built for users who value autonomy, transparency, and reproducibility. It’s designed to serve writers, educators, and compliance professionals who distrust opaque systems and prefer tools that do one thing well—without compromise.</p> <h2>Design Principles</h2> <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-slate-300"><li><strong>Privacy-first:</strong> No tracking, no uploads, no hidden analytics</li> <li><strong>Stateless:</strong> Everything runs in-browser, with no persistent storage</li> <li><strong>Modular:</strong> Each feature is independently testable and documented</li> <li><strong>Accessible:</strong> Built with semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and high contrast</li> <li><strong>Transparent:</strong> Open-source and auditable by anyone</li></ul> <h3>Why We Built It</h3> <p>Most link validators are cloud-bound, slow, or invasive. This tool was born out of frustration with those limitations—and a desire to empower users with something fast, local, and trustworthy. It’s part of a broader mission to create privacy-first utilities that respect user intent and minimize friction.</p> <h2>FAQ</h2> <details class="mb-4"><summary class="cursor-pointer text-yellow-400">Is this tool part of a larger suite?</summary> <p class="text-slate-300 pl-4">Yes. It’s one of several privacy-first tools under the AxelBase banner, designed for clarity and autonomy.</p></details> <details class="mb-4"><summary class="cursor-pointer text-yellow-400">Can I contribute to the project?</summary> <p class="text-slate-300 pl-4">Absolutely.
