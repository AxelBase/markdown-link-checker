Unlike many online validators that require uploading files to remote servers, this utility runs entirely in your browser. No data ever leaves your device, ensuring complete privacy and security for sensitive or proprietary content.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Broken links damage user trust, hurt SEO performance, and create poor reading experiences. Whether you maintain technical documentation, a personal blog, open-source project READMEs, or large knowledge bases, catching broken or redirected links early saves time and prevents embarrassment. This tool makes that process fast, accurate, and reproducible.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Why a Client-Side Solution Matters</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Many existing link checkers send your Markdown content to external servers for processing. This raises privacy concerns, especially for internal company wikis, unreleased documentation, or compliance-sensitive materials. The Markdown Link Checker eliminates that risk by performing all parsing, extraction, and validation locally using modern browser APIs.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">You can upload one or multiple Markdown files, paste raw text directly, or work with large documents up to 1 MB. The entire workflow—from link extraction to status reporting—happens instantly in your browser without any network transmission beyond the actual link checks themselves.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Core Features at a Glance</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">The tool supports inline links, reference-style links, relative paths, and in-page anchor links. It performs lightweight HEAD or fetch requests to determine if external URLs return valid status codes. Redirects are followed and reported clearly, while timeouts and unreachable hosts are flagged appropriately.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Results appear in an interactive table grouped by status: Valid, Broken, Redirected, Skipped, or Ignored. Each entry shows the link text, full URL, line number in the source, and final status code. Built-in filtering, sorting, and search make it easy to focus on problem areas quickly.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Who Benefits Most</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Technical writers producing long-form guides benefit from catching dead links before publication. Open-source maintainers can verify README and docs in pull requests. Static site generators users can integrate pre-publish checks into their workflow. Educators sharing course materials avoid frustrating students with outdated resources.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Because everything runs locally, teams in regulated industries or those handling confidential information can use the tool freely without policy violations.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Getting Started</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Simply visit the site, upload your Markdown file or paste content, adjust optional settings like timeout and concurrency, then click Validate Links. Results appear immediately, ready for export as TXT or JSON, or quick clipboard copy.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">The Markdown Link Checker puts reliable link validation directly in your hands—private, fast, and completely under your control.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1tq17n3">Start checking your Markdown links today and keep your content trustworthy.</p></article></div>');function T(p){var e=b();g(h=>{var n=w();m.title="Introducing the Markdown Link Checker | Markdown Link Checker Blog";var k=v(y(n),6);t(4),r(()=>l(k,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post1`)),s(h,n)});var a=o(e),u=o(a);t(4),i(a),t(2),i(e),r(()=>l(u,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),s(p,e)}export{T as component,S as universal};
