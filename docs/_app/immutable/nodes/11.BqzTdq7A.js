The Markdown Link Checker includes a virtual file tree feature that enables accurate validation of these internal references entirely in the browser.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Relative links like ./images/logo.png or ../guide/install.md rely on project structure. Anchor links such as #installation point to headings within the same or linked documents. Without context, these appear broken during simple validation.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">The Virtual File Tree</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Available in the configuration panel, the virtual file tree accepts a simple text representation of your project directory. List files and folders using standard indentation or JSON-like syntax to mirror actual paths.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Once defined, the tool resolves relative paths against this structure. Missing files or incorrect paths receive Broken status with clear indications, while valid ones mark as Valid.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Anchor Link Validation</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">In-page anchors are checked automatically against headings extracted from the current document. Links to #non-existent-section flag as broken, helping catch typos early.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">When combined with the virtual tree, cross-document anchors like other-file.md#setup resolve properly if the target file exists in the defined structure and contains the heading.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Setting Up the Tree</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Start with a basic list of your main Markdown files and key folders. For small sites, a flat list suffices. Larger documentation benefits from nested representation showing subdirectories.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">The format is flexible and forgiving—focus on accurate relative paths from your entry file. Update the tree as your project grows or restructures.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Benefits for Projects</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, or MkDocs produce complex relative link networks. Validating these locally before build catches issues early.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Open-source repositories with extensive docs folders gain confidence that internal navigation works across branches. Technical writers working on book-style guides ensure chapter links remain intact.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Limitations and Tips</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">The virtual tree is client-side only and session-based—no data leaves your browser. For very large projects, include only relevant subsections to keep input manageable.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Combine with ignore patterns for assets like images if you prefer to focus solely on Markdown navigation.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Enabling full internal validation transforms the tool from external checker to complete project auditor.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Accurate relative and anchor validation keeps complex documentation reliable and user-friendly.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-jo8es1">Build confidence in your internal links with the virtual file tree.</p></article></div>');function P(d){var e=b();k(u=>{var s=j();m.title="Validating Relative Paths and Anchor Links | Markdown Link Checker Blog";var v=f(g(s),6);t(4),i(()=>l(v,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post7`)),o(u,s)});var a=r(e),h=r(a);t(4),n(a),t(2),n(e),i(()=>l(h,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),o(d,e)}export{P as component,A as universal};
