Our <a class="hover:underline">Markdown Link Checker</a> lets you export findings in two formats—TXT and JSON—each suited to different workflows. Whether you're collaborating with editors or integrating into a CI pipeline, the export options are designed to be flexible and frictionless.</p> <h2>TXT Format</h2> <p>TXT exports are simple and human-readable. Each line includes the link text, URL, status, and optional notes. This format is ideal for manual review, editorial checklists, or quick sharing in chat threads and bug reports.</p> <h2>JSON Format</h2> <p>JSON exports are structured and machine-readable. They include full metadata for each link—text, URL, line number, status, and category. This format is perfect for automation, audits, or integration into static site generators and CI workflows.</p> <h3>Use Cases</h3> <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-slate-300"><li><strong>TXT:</strong> Editorial review, manual fixes, team feedback</li> <li><strong>JSON:</strong> Programmatic ingestion, dashboards, automated reporting</li> <li><strong>Clipboard:</strong> Quick copy-paste into GitHub issues or Slack threads</li></ul> <h2>Export Workflow</h2> <p>After validation, use the export buttons to download your results. You can also copy them to your clipboard with a single click. No data is stored or transmitted—everything is generated locally in your browser.</p> <h2>FAQ</h2> <details class="mb-4"><summary class="cursor-pointer text-yellow-400">Can I export both formats?</summary> <p class="text-slate-300 pl-4">Yes.
