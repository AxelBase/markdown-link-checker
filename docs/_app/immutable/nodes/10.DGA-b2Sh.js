Our <a class="hover:underline">Markdown Link Checker</a> is built to handle large files and complex folder structures without compromising speed or privacy.</p> <h2>Performance Features</h2> <p>To ensure smooth validation across hundreds of links, the tool includes several configurable options:</p> <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-slate-300"><li><strong>Concurrency Limit:</strong> Controls how many links are checked in parallel. Lower values reduce browser strain; higher values speed up processing.</li> <li><strong>Timeout (ms):</strong> Defines how long the tool waits before marking a link as unreachable. Useful for slow or intermittent servers.</li> <li><strong>Ignore Patterns:</strong> Lets you exclude known problematic domains or paths from validation.</li> <li><strong>Virtual File Tree:</strong> Simulates your folder structure so relative links can be resolved accurately, even across nested directories.</li></ul> <h3>Best Practices</h3> <p>When working with large Markdown sets, consider these tips:</p> <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-slate-300"><li>Break content into modular files and validate incrementally.</li> <li>Use consistent link formatting to reduce parsing errors.</li> <li>Exclude known unreachable links using ignore patterns.</li> <li>Test performance in different browsers—Chrome and Firefox handle concurrency best.</li></ul> <h2>FAQ</h2> <details class="mb-4"><summary class="cursor-pointer text-yellow-400">Can I validate hundreds of links?</summary> <p class="text-slate-300 pl-4">Yes.
